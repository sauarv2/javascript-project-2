          <h1>Here’s Where COVID-19 Cases Are <br>Rising and Falling</h1>
          <p>The number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States skyrocketed this past week while the rates of hospitalizations and deaths increased slightly.

            According to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average number of new COVID-19 cases are now sitting at about 240,000 a day, almost 100,000 more than a week ago. The figures include the more than 400,000 new cases reported on Dec. 27.
            
            The total number of new COVID-19 cases for the week that ended Dec. 12 was listed at more than 1.4. million, an increase of 55 percent from the previous week.
            
            Deaths attributed to COVID-19 for the same time period were listed at 10,153, a jump of 11 percent from a week ago.</p>

            <p>“I definitely think we could see more increases as cold weather hits,” Dr. Jamila Taylor, director of healthcare reform and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, told Healthline.

              “Another factor is holiday travel. We are in the thick of it. Omicron is spreading and Delta remains the dominant, deadlier variant. More Americans are traveling, domestically and internationally, so we are not yet out of the woods. Not by a long shot.
              
              “The best we can all do is continue to mask up, practice good hygiene, and be smart about distancing ourselves. For those who have yet to get vaccinated or boosted, it is of urgent importance that they do so,” Taylor said.
              
              “The COVID picture varies across the country,” added Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.</p>
